// Hash is a hashing function that takes a vertex of type T and returns a hash value of type K.

// custom data type, provide your own function:
//
//	cityHash := func(c City) string {

// graph stores integer vertices:
//
//	g := graph.New(graph.IntHash)
//	g.AddVertex(1)
//	g.AddVertex(2)
//	g.AddVertex(3)
//
// The provided IntHash hashing function takes an integer and uses it as a hash value at the same

//
//	type City struct {

//
//	cityHash := func(c City) string {

// parameters can be inferred from the hashing function.
//
// All traits of the graph can be set using the predefined functional options. They can be combined
// arbitrarily. This example creates a directed acyclic graph:
//
//	g := graph.New(graph.IntHash, graph.Directed(), graph.Acyclic())
