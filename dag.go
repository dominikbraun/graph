// TopologicalSort runs a topological sort on a given directed graph and returns

// order of vertices in a directed graph where an edge from vertex A to vertex B
// implies that vertex A appears before vertex B.
//
// Note that TopologicalSort doesn't make any guarantees about the order. If there
// are multiple valid topological orderings, an arbitrary one will be returned.
// To make the output deterministic, use [StableTopologicalSort].
//
// TopologicalSort only works for directed acyclic graphs. This implementation
// works non-recursively and utilizes Kahn's algorithm.
